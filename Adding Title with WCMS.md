When we go www.ourwebsitesexampledomainname.com/cmscockpit , we will see two types of catalog: "staged" and "online". 
Generally, we can do some changes in stage catalog and if it is works, then we synchronize content catalog with online. 
Online is the current version of live project. So we don't want to manipulate here directly.

Then in staged catalog, we should find page which we want to do something in this catalogs pages list. In this finded pages
details, you can see the information part of our finded page on right section of current page. If title header is empty, there 
is no title exist in our page. We can add a value to this area, it's going to be our pages title. Now, we can see the title,
in browsers tab on top and also we can see in breadcrumb if it is exist.

In this page, we can see the wcms settings for a wishlist page as an example.There is a title section exist and its filled 
with 'Favorilerim' in Turkish. If English was selected as a main language, we could see it like 'Favorites' or something else.
When I say above before, this wishlist page's title is "Favorilerim" in Turkish now and we  can see it in browsers tab section
and breadcrumb.
